##### Acknowledgements and references
I found this project especially challenging. 
It took me a long time to fetch the data and to understand server side API. 
I would like to thank my tutor Alexis Gonzalis for the guidance and support. I was struggling with making the page dynamic and he helped me with the web api code in javascript. With his help, I was able to change the code to a more dynamic one. 
Along with this, I read through the content in websites and watched class videos, got support from peers to understand some concepts.
