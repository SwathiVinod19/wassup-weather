##### Acknowledgements and references
I found this project especially challenging. It took me a long time to fetch the data and to understand server side API. I would like to thank my tutor Alexis Gonzalis for the guidance and support. I read through the content in websites and watched my class videos, got support from peers to understand some concepts.
